# ServerlessApp
In this first stage, my idea is have the front end using the s3 bucket who will be created using the *s3bucket.tf* code. 
Still, is a testing of my little skills on serverless. This is a work in progress. 
The idea is create API/Lambda functions to deploy two main functions. 
  -Create a register in an existing DB using DynamoDB
  -List all the registers in the Database. (Both functions are the ones showed at the index.html
  -The database will be previously created with some test registers. 

## **Stage 1** --> Create the S3 site 
In the index.html there is a HTML template with two buttons. 
This index will be at the definition of the site using static site S3 feature. **@Andy** is going to "make up" a little bit the index.html 

## **Stage 2** --> Connect the index.html with the backend
How should I connect the functions  (backend) of my index.html. Using an internal API? HTTP API or REST? The connection is direct from the bucket? For the moment, in the s3 static website configuration (the index.html bucket) I can add redirection rules pointing to API (HTTP or REST) external URL. Basically I can redirect to another object within the bucket or to a external resource (URL) 

## **Stage 3** --> The backend logic and the code
Backend "Logic"
  -Deploy the code to PUT information in the previously created database using Dynamo.
  -Deploy the code to GET all the register from the DATABASE. Note, in some point, how to show the informati√≥n will be a problem (maybe). 
 
There will be a fixed register for the new items, lambda functions will be deployed using Python SDK.
