# ServerlessApp
In this first stage, my idea is have the front end using the s3 bucket who will be created using the s3.tf code. 
Still is a testing of my little skills on serverless. This is a Work in Progress. 
The idea is create API/Lambda functions to deploy two main functions. 
  -Create a register in an existing DB using DynamoDB
  -List all the registers in the Database.
  -The database will be previously created with some test registers. 

#Stage 1 --> Create the S3 site
In the index.html there is a template with two buttons. This is a very simple app to test a serverless / SaaS backend. 


#Stage 3 -->
